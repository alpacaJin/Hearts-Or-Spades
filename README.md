# Hearts Or Spades

<ins>The Cybergeddon</ins>

The world went to war five years ago over a globalized sabotage of all computerized networks from a malicious terrorist organization that calls itself The Sword. With the internet swarming with hacker intelligence that could detect, infiltrate, and terminate any piece of technology made after 1983, the world erupted into chaos. Communication became dangerous, the military obsolete, and the ability to produce food and trade money practically nonexistent. The disintegration of the seven world powers into economic collapse left its people in a fit of panic and fear.

Two years later, the world began to suffer from widespread pandemics, nuclear warfare, and territorial division of land and sea; the death count raged in the billions.

Today, The Sword is the most advanced society on Earth; an oasis in an otherwise backward, apocalyptic world. Survivors have learned how to become invisible to the ever-present watch of their nation's corrupted cameras and satellites, relying solely on old tech and agricultural methods. Resistance is few and far between, but rumors of a stronger tech being developed in the land of Amacstan is a harbinger for hope. A revolution is brewing and you are at the center of the restlessness.
